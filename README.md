# MovieBox

MovieBox is a tool to receive film, cast, images, ratings, and trailers using the IMDb API. Users are able to search for any movie and have it displayed within seconds. What helps MovieBox stand is is the clean and organized design that makes every movie look all the more interesting.

* Search movies by title, genre, cast
* View upcoming movies by custom date

# How It Works #

Setup:
Download the source code and start a new react project using npm run start.

Technology:
1. React
2. React Router
3. reg Javascript
4. imDb API

You can confiure the default movie list by modifying the search term in components/Home.js .

Line 12: this.performSearch("pokemon");

Below you will find the custom website designed that I created for the app and mobile later using React Native.
